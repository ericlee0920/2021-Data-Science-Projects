    - Draw a workflow and divided work for a total of at least 4 hrs/person each week = 36 hrs/group at least in total
    - Validate the workflow and try out different packages
    - Visualize workflow and results

## FAQ

1. How much help am I going to get?

          A: You will get help when encountered conceptual problems and implementation design problems during meetings. You will not get taught how to code or what is a RNA that you can google for. 
  
2. Will you help me deal with people who are not working?

          A: No. They'll look bad themselves during the meeting.

3. What happens if you anyone forges results or copies results?

          A: It'll turn out really bad during peer review. You won't be able to explain it anyway.

4. What happens if I am bad at programming and I don't know what to do?

          A: Consult your group members and try online programming youtube videos.
