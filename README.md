## Projects
The two projects listed below are prepared and presented for the Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference at the University of British Columbia in March 2021.

### Project 1: miRNA Expression-Based Classification of Breast Cancer
This project presents a workflow to perform classification on breast cancer patients using miRNA expression data. Various clustering and other statistical methods were applied to public datasets from TCGA.

### Project 2: Modeling of Meteorological factors of COVID-19
This project evaluates the significance of meterological factors on COVID-19 infection rates in various regions of Canada. Linear regression, regression trees, and a random forest regressor were applied to public data.
